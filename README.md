# 🚀 HackerRank Practice Solutions

Welcome to my **HackerRank Practice Repo**!  
Here I'm sharing my journey of solving coding challenges to sharpen my problem-solving skills, learn new techniques, and prepare for technical interviews.

Each solution is written with a focus on:
- **Clarity** 🧠
- **Efficiency** ⚡
- **Good coding practices** 📜
- **Well-explained comments** 💬
